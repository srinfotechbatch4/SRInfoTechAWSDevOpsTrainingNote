1)The devops engineer was responsibility to release the product to the market as soon as possible

2)  release the product speed to the market

3)Devops engineer was give continues feedback to the developers

4) Devops engineer responsibility start from git and end with production

Benefits of DevOps ::
===================

•	Faster software delivery: Reduces lead times and speeds up the software delivery process 

•	Higher software quality: Addresses bugs quicker and improves software quality 

•	Better collaboration: Unifies development and operations teams, enhancing collaboration and efficiency 

•	Competitive advantage: Creates a more nimble software development lifecycle that gives businesses an advantage over their competitors

Github Introduction::
===============

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to store and manage their code in repositories.

Version Control: ::
GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code. This allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's contributions.

Repositories::: where you can store your project files and track the history of changes made to those files.Public and private repos can be created depending on accessibility needs.



Git & Github Integration::
============================

Github Branching Model::
=======================

A GitHub branching model is a structured way of organizing branches in a Git repository to manage development workflows effectively. It helps teams work collaboratively, isolate features, manage releases, and deploy code more efficiently.


<img width="1798" height="749" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8965c1f6-c445-4909-8998-50cd188c211b" />

Sample Repository Hello-World Project::
=========================================

https://github.com/srinfotechbatch4/srinfotechbatch4demo.git

Branches:
==========
main (or master): Always production-ready.

feature/*: Used for new features.

release/*: Prepares for a new production release.

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.06.22

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.07.20

hotfix branch:: always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes

bugfix:: this branch is created from release branch to fix the LLE(lower level environemnt)/Pre-Prod/UAT/Non-Prod issues and once LLE issues fixed ,we should pushed their changes to release branch only.


Raise PR (Pull Request) ::
=========================

Merge the code from one branch to another branch that is called pull request

below are the steps to raise PR::

Go to -->Pull requests and click

3.For every company will do sequence build on one project this is recommended approach



General  ---just descriptin

SCM

where is your project--github, bitbucket

Triggere

whenever code changes i want build the project given time

Environmant

--all about workspaces folders

Build Steps

dev team will tell which tool we are using in current project


Post Build

devops engineer is aim is given continue feedback to dev team via email notification

Pipelines Introduction:::
=============================

A Jenkins pipeline is a series of automated steps or stages that define the process of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your code. Jenkins, being a popular open-source automation server, uses pipelines to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

There are two types of Jenkins pipelines:

1. Declarative Pipeline

2. Scripted Pipeline

1. Declarative Pipeline::
The declarative pipeline syntax is simpler and more structured. It's the recommended style for most users because it's easy to read and maintain

Key elements in the declarative pipeline:::
======================================

pipeline: This is the top-level structure.

agent: Specifies where the pipeline will run, such as on any available agent, a specific node, or a Docker container.

stages: Defines the different steps or stages in the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).

steps: Commands to be executed in each stage.



Please try to create one pipeline job in jenkinsfile and execute the below Declarative pipeline example:;

pipeline {

agent any

stages {
    stage('Clone') {
        steps {
            git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/srinfotech7358/spring-petclinic.git'

It provides a simple, reliable platform for deploying and managing Java Servlets and JSPs and is widely used in both development and production environments. Its ease of use, combined with powerful features and flexibility, makes it an ideal choice for many developers working on Java-based web applications.

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container that is primarily used to serve Java-based web applications. It implements several Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specifications, such as Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and WebSocket, among others. Tomcat is often used to run Java applications on the web because it's lightweight, easy to configure, and widely supported.

Here are some key points about Tomcat:

1. **Servlet Container**: Tomcat is a servlet container, meaning it manages the lifecycle of Java Servlets, which are small Java programs that run on a web server.
  
2. **JSP Support**: Tomcat also supports JavaServer Pages (JSP), a technology that allows for embedding Java code within HTML pages.

3. **Configuration**: It’s highly configurable through XML files, like `server.xml` for server settings, `web.xml` for application settings, and others.

4. **Lightweight**: Unlike full-fledged application servers like WildFly (formerly JBoss) or GlassFish, Tomcat is primarily a servlet and JSP container, which makes it lighter and easier to deploy for simpler Java web applications.

5. **Performance**: It’s known for good performance in handling static content, making it a popular choice for Java web developers.

Integrate Tomcat Jenkins::
==============================

Integrating Tomcat with Jenkins is a common use case for automating the deployment of Java-based web applications. Jenkins can be set up to deploy a web application to a Tomcat server whenever a new build is triggered.

Prerequisites:

Apache Tomcat should be installed and running on your server.

Jenkins should be installed and running.

Steps to integrate Jenkins with Tomcat:

1. Install the "Deploy to Container" Plugin in Jenkins:
The easiest way to deploy to Tomcat from Jenkins is by using the Deploy to Container plugin. This plugin allows Jenkins to deploy WAR files to a Tomcat server.

Go to your Jenkins dashboard.

Click on Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.

In the Available tab, search for Deploy to Container Plugin and install it.

Once installed, restart Jenkins to apply the plugin.

2. Configure Tomcat Server in Jenkins:
Now you need to tell Jenkins where your Tomcat server is running.

In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.

Scroll down to the Deploy to container section.

Click Add Tomcat Server.

Provide the necessary information:

Name: Give the Tomcat server a name (Tomcat9).

URL: The URL of your Tomcat server (e.g., http://localhost:8080).

Username: The username for Tomcat's manager app (usually admin).

Password: The password for that username (set in Tomcat's tomcat-users.xml).

Save the configuration.

3. Configure Tomcat’s tomcat-users.xml:

Make sure Tomcat is set up to allow Jenkins to deploy the application by editing the tomcat-users.xml file.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3d43081-1646-4980-b961-1743418f303f" />






  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  
  <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
 
  <role rolename="manager-status"/>
  
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
 
  <role rolename="admin-script"/>
 
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status, admin-gui, admin-script"/>




Restart Tomcat to apply the changes.

4. Create a Jenkins Job to Build and Deploy the Application:

Next, you need to create a Jenkins job that will build your web application (e.g., a WAR file) and deploy it to Tomcat.

From the Jenkins dashboard, click New Item.

Select Freestyle Project, give it a name, and click OK.

In the job configuration, go to the Build section and configure your build step, such as building a Maven project For Maven, you can use:

> mvn clean install

In the Post-build Actions section, add Deploy war/ear to a container.

In the WAR/EAR files field, provide the path to your WAR file (e.g., target/my-app.war).
In the Container field, choose the Tomcat server you configured earlier.
Set the Context Path (e.g., IfocusAWSDevOpsTraining), which is the URL path where the application will be accessible on Tomcat.
If you want Jenkins to deploy automatically after every successful build, check the option Deploy after every successful build.
Save the job.

5. Trigger the Build and Deployment:
Go to the Jenkins job you just created and click Build Now to trigger a build.
After the build completes, Jenkins should deploy the WAR file to your Tomcat server.

You can access your application by going to http://<tomcat_host>:<tomcat_port>/<context_path>

example::  http://localhost:8080/SRINFOTECHApplication/

POLL SCM:: * * * * * (every minute automatic build & deployment happend when new commits happend in github)

This setup will allow Jenkins to automatically build and deploy your Java web application to Tomcat with each new build


Polling SCM (Source Code Management) and webhooks are two common methods used for integrating continuous integration (CI) systems or automating tasks based on changes in repositories.

1. Polling SCM

Polling SCM is a method where a system (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.) periodically checks the source code repository for changes. If it detects changes, it triggers the build process or some other automated task.

How it works:

A job is set up to check the SCM (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or hour).

The CI server pulls the repository to see if there are any new commits since the last poll.

If changes are detected, it triggers the CI/CD pipeline to build, test, or deploy the application.

2. Webhooks

Webhooks provide a more efficient method for triggering actions based on changes in the repository. Rather than the CI system polling for changes, the source control platform sends an HTTP POST request (webhook) to the CI system when an event (like a commit or pull request) occurs.

Continuous Integration & Continutes Deployment & COntinuoues Delivery::
=======================================================================

Continuous Integration(CI)::the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple Developers into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository,after which automated builds and tests are run automatically.

developers frequently commit to a shared repository using a version control system such as Git,A continuous integration automatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes to immediately using jenkins Orchestration.

Continuous Deployment(CD) :: Continuous Deployment is an extension of continuous delivery. With continuous deployment, every change that passes through the automated tests and builds is automatically deployed to production without any human intervention. The deployment process is fully automated.

Continuous Delivery (CD)::Continuous Delivery is a software development practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production in a consistent and reliable manner. The key distinction of continuous delivery is that the process of deploying the code to production is done manually by a human decision-maker.

Integrate Jenkins with Tomcat using Declarative Approach::
============================================

To integrate Jenkins with Tomcat using the Declarative Pipeline approach, you'll be using Jenkins Pipeline syntax to automate the deployment process to a Tomcat server. This process typically involves building the application, packaging it, and then deploying it to Tomcat.

1. Jenkinsfile Configuration (Declarative Pipeline)

In your Jenkins project, you'll create a Jenkinsfile, which contains the Declarative Pipeline syntax. This file defines the steps involved in the CI/CD pipeline.

Please execute below script in jenkins pipeline job using Declarative style

Artifact Repository Management:

Allows for storing binaries and artifacts (e.g., libraries, packages, Docker images) in a centralized location.
Supports all major package types (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm, NuGet, RubyGems, etc.).
Version Control:

Helps in managing versions of your artifacts and ensures the correct version is used during builds and deployments.
Integration with CI/CD:

Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Bamboo, GitLab CI, and others.
Enables automated publishing of artifacts as part of your continuous integration pipeline.
Access Control & Security:

Provides fine-grained access control and permissions for users and groups.

AWS (Amazon Web Services)::
====================

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform offered by Amazon. It provides a broad set of services to help organizations and individuals build and scale applications, manage data, and process workloads in the cloud. AWS is designed to provide flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solutions for computing, storage, networking, machine learning, and much more.

AWS ---Amazon web services

compute services::
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Provides scalable virtual servers to run applications.
AWS Lambda: Lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales based on usage.

Storage services::
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage for storing and retrieving large amounts of data.
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): Persistent block-level storage for EC2 instances.

Database::
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational database service supporting multiple database engines (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, etc.).
Amazon DynamoDB: A managed NoSQL database service.
Amazon Aurora: A high-performance relational database engine compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Network services::
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Lets you create isolated networks within AWS for secure connections.

Security ::

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): Controls user access and permissions for AWS resources.
AWS KMS (Key Management Service): Managed service for creating and controlling encryption keys.
Security groups ---inbound, outbould roles


Containers & kuberneties::
ECS  ---elastic containers servcies
EKS  ----estastic kuberneties services
AKS  ---Azure kuberneties services

Cloud watch --Metrics Monitoring

CloudWatch Metrics allows you to track the performance and utilization of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Lambda functions, S3 buckets, and much more.
These metrics include CPU utilization, disk activity, network traffic, and others. You can create custom metrics for your applications or services as well.

cloud trail ---Security Monitoring:

Use CloudTrail logs to detect unauthorized access or activity in your AWS environment. You can track changes in security settings, unauthorized API calls, or unexpected configuration changes.

Developer Tools::
AWS CodeCommit: Source control service for managing your code repositories.
AWS CodeDeploy: Automates code deployments to EC2 instances and Lambda.
AWS CodePipeline: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service for automating the release pipeline.

AWS EC2 ::
===========

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is one of the core services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Wide Variety of Instance Types:

EC2 instances are grouped into families based on the type of workload they are optimized for. Some common instance families include:

General Purpose: e.g., t3, m5 instances (balanced CPU, memory, and networking).

Compute Optimized: e.g., c5 instances (great for high-performance computing tasks).

Memory Optimized: e.g., r5, x1e instances (designed for high-memory workloads like databases).

Ansible:: Configuration Mamagement Tool(CM)::
==============================================

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and multi-node orchestration. It helps system administrators and DevOps professionals automate IT processes to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and simplify complex workflows.


<img width="1665" height="749" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c41bdfd2-1a7d-4370-8888-2af0c888f7b6" />




13/11/2025::
============



Key Features of Ansible:
================
Agentless: Ansible doesn't require any agents to be installed on the target machines. It uses SSH (or WinRM for Windows systems) to communicate with remote nodes.

Declarative Syntax: Ansible uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) to define the tasks, which makes it easy to read and write.

Idempotent: Ansible ensures that running the same playbook multiple times has the same effect, meaning it won’t reapply configurations if they’ve already been applied correctly.

Modular: Ansible has a large number of pre-built modules that can be used to manage various systems, applications, and services.

Playbooks: These are YAML files that describe the automation tasks you want to run. Playbooks are the heart of Ansible automation and define the "what" and "how" of your automation tasks.

Inventory Management: Ansible can manage an inventory of systems, which is used to organize and target different sets of machines.

Basic Components:
==================
Inventory: A list of hosts (machines) that Ansible will manage.

Playbook: A YAML file that defines the tasks and roles to be applied to the inventory.

Roles: A way to group related tasks and files together in a reusable manner.

Modules: Pre-built commands that Ansible can run on target systems to accomplish specific tasks (e.g., file management, system configuration, etc.).

Structure of a Basic Playbook:::
===============================

A basic playbook has the following components:

YAML Header: The file begins with a --- to indicate it’s a YAML file.

the hosts (target machines) become: yes ----->Sudo user

Tasks: Tasks define the actions to be executed on the target systems.

I want to see where the Ansible is installed on ACS::
===================================================

>cd /etc/ansible

NOTE::
======

Playbook is written in YAML format

Inside the playbook tasks

Each task is a module

Playbook is a one of yaml file

Yaml file is a collection of key-value pairsset of all tasks

Playbook is tell to the ansible what are the tasks can be performed

Each task is a one module

Module is a smallest item of ansible

Module can be used to individual or smallest task can be performed

Any configuration management tool should maintain ‘state’

hosts: all (apply all we can be mentioned in inventory )

become: yes (become user as a sudo user)

============


Executing ansible in 2 ways
1.	Adhoc command  yearly base

2.	Playbook (YAML/YML) format use for repetitive work

When we can use adhoc commands  ->I want restart servers yearly base 

if you can use system inventory, below is the command

>ansible-playbook <playbookname>

>ansible-playbook hello-world.yml

I don’t want to use system level inventory

Inventory::
==========
where hosts/ipaddress are stored

I want to create my own inventory

>Cd /etc/ansible

>sudo mkdir SRINFOTECH

>cd /etc/ansible/SRINFOTECH

>sudo vi srhosts


Copy all the hosts with groups like below

[web_servers]

node1@172.31.23.83

[app_servers]

node2@172.31.23.199

ansible@172.31.24.75

[DB_servers]

node1@172.31.23.83

node2@172.31.23.199

ansible@172.31.24.75



I want categories into Inventory groups::
===================================

In Ansible, inventory groups are used to organize and categorize hosts (machines or servers) into logical groups. This allows you to apply tasks to specific sets of servers, simplifying playbook management and execution. An inventory is a list of managed hosts and their associated metadata, and groups are one of the key components of that structure.

Here’s a detailed explanation of Ansible inventory groups

1. What Are Inventory Groups?
An inventory group in Ansible is a way to group hosts based on a shared characteristic. For example, you might have groups for different environments (e.g., dev, prod), different types of servers (e.g., web_servers, db_servers), or other logical categories that fit your needs.

static inventory groups defined in the standard INI or YAML format.

# Define groups of hosts:: >sudo vi srhosts

[web_servers]

node1@172.31.11.24

[App_servers]

node2@172.31.0.185

ansible@172.31.6.13

[DB_servers]

node1@172.31.11.24

node2@172.31.0.185

ansible@172.31.6.13
 
i want to insatll 3 spfwares :: below playbook name -----> installsoftware.yml

  tasks:
  
  -  name: install git
    
     apt:
     
       name: git
     
       state: present
     
       update_cache: yes

  -  name: install tree

       state: present  

  -  name: install apache
  
     apt:
     
       name: apache2
     
       state: present

once above two files created run the below command

>ansible-playbook -i srhosts installsoftware.yml
     
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36d33a9a-b113-402c-80f7-1e9c404a245b)

>ansible -i srhosts -m ping Webserver

Best practice is you need to create our own inventories

>sudo vi srhosts

after ran the above yaml, please try to access all machines with IPaddresss

Please enabled Inbound and Outbound rules::
=======================================

Inbound and outbound rules refer to the types of network traffic that are allowed or denied to and from a system, such as a server, virtual machine, or network device. These rules are typically defined in firewalls or security groups (such as in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud). The primary goal is to control which data can enter or leave a network, ensuring security and proper access control.

Here’s a detailed explanation of inbound and outbound rules:

 Inbound Rules::
Inbound rules control traffic entering a system or network. These rules define which types of external traffic are allowed to reach a server, instance, or device.

Common Uses:
Allowing specific users or services to access the system.

Restricting access to the system from unauthorized users.

Opening ports for services like web servers (HTTP, HTTPS), SSH, database connections, etc

Allowing incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP) so that users can access a web server.

Outbound Rules::
Outbound rules control traffic leaving a system or network. These rules define which traffic is allowed to exit a server or device and reach external destinations.

Common Uses:
Allowing a server to access external services like APIs, databases, or external servers.

Restricting unwanted traffic from the system to external destinations.

Controlling the flow of outgoing traffic to ensure compliance with security policies.

Allow HTTP/HTTPS: Allow outbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to any IP:

Install LAMP on ubuntu 24.04::
==================================

A LAMP stack stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, which is a popular open-source software stack used for web development. It provides everything you need to set up a dynamic website or web application.

Here’s a quick overview of each component:

Linux: The operating system (in this case, Ubuntu).

Apache: The web server that serves your website’s files.

MySQL: The database management system for storing and retrieving data.

PHP: The programming language used for dynamic web page generation.



Manual Steps::
====================

loop::
===========


In Ansible, loops are used to repeat tasks over a list of items, making automation more efficient and reducing redundancy in playbooks. You can loop through arrays, dictionaries, and other types of data in Ansible to execute tasks multiple times.

There are several ways to use loops in Ansible, and here are the most common methods:

1. Using loop keyword
The loop keyword is the most common way to iterate over a list of items. Here's an example of how to use it:

Setup module in ansible::
============================


https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html

Setup module is used to collect the facts

Facts information gather from nodes called facts

>ansible -I srhosts -m setup Webserver

Using filter command

>ansible -i srhosts -m setup -a "filter=*os*" Webserver

>ansible -i srhosts -m setup -a "filter=*ansible_os_family*" Webserver

ansible_os_family": "Debian"

Ansible when statements

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#the-when-statement


ansible_os_family": "Debian"

When condition is always used bottom of the script and using scrips we can able to run a playbook on a different platforms 

1.Debian

2.Redhat

Ansible Variable::
===================

In Ansible, variables are used to store values that can be referenced and used throughout your playbooks, roles, and tasks. This allows for dynamic, reusable, and flexible automation. Here’s a basic breakdown of how Ansible variables work and the different ways you can define and use them:


define variables in 3 places::
===============================

1.	Inventory level  lowest priority

   a. host level variabels
  
  node1@172.31.27.17 package_name=apache2
  
  package_name=httpd
  
  b. group level variabels

[web_servers]
node1@172.31.27.17 

package_name=apache2

2.playbook level  ---2nd highest priroty 

vars:
    package_name: git

3.	Command line level –highest level priority

>ansible-playbook -i srinfotechhosts -e "package_name=apache2" variable.yml

Inventory variables: These are defined in the inventory file (or dynamic inventory) for specific hosts or groups.

[webservers]
ansiblenode1@172.31.20.135  package_name=git
ansiblenode2@172.31.30.200 package_name=apache2
localhost 

[webservers:vars]
ansiblenode2@172.31.30.200 
localhost 

package_name=httpd

Playbook variables: You can define variables directly within your playbooks using the vars section.

---
- hosts: Webservers

  become: yes

  vars:

  pacakge_name: git

  tasks:
    
    - name: Install all packages

      apt:

      name: "{{ pacakge_name }}"

      state: present

      Command-line variables: You can pass variables to your playbooks at runtime using the -e or --extra-vars option.
      

      >ansible-playbook -i hosts -e "package_name=apache2" variables2.yml



Ansible resolves variable values based on a specific precedence order. The order from highest to lowest precedence is:
====================================================================================================================

Extra-vars (-e on the command line): Command-line variables take the highest precedence.

Playbook variables: Variables defined within the playbook.

Inventory variables: Variables set in the inventory.

Ansible Roles::
===================


<img width="1648" height="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebb677ec-7471-46ec-a449-b154fda14ff6" />


Ansible roles are a way of organizing playbooks and tasks in a modular, reusable, and maintainable structure. They allow you to break down complex playbooks into smaller, focused units of functionality that can be easily shared and reused across different projects. Here's a more detailed look at Ansible roles:

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html

1.Written ansible in a reusable fashion

2.How do I use someone else’s work

3.Ansible galaxy is a place where we can find reusable roles

https://galaxy.ansible.com/

4.Which we can use in your script



install roles

 > Ansible-galaxy install <rolename>

 >ansible-galaxy install my_role

create my own role::

> ansible-galaxy init <rolename>

>ansible-galaxy init my_role



Structure of Ansible Roles::
===================

my_role/
├── defaults/
│   └── main.yml            # Default variables
├── files/
│   └── somefile            # Files to be copied to the target
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml            # Handlers (usually for service restarts)
├── meta/
│   └── main.yml            # Metadata about the role
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml            # The main tasks (this file includes other task files if needed)
├── templates/
│   └── config.j2           # Jinja2 templates for dynamic file creation
├── tests/
│   └── test.yml            # Test playbooks to verify the role works
├── vars/
│   └── main.yml            # Custom variables


Using Roles in Playbooks
Once you've defined a role, you can use it in your playbook like this:

---
- name: Example Playbook using roles
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - my_role

Benefits of Using Roles
Reusability: Roles can be reused across different playbooks and projects.

Modularity: Roles allow you to organize your playbook into smaller, manageable parts.

Clarity: Each role focuses on a specific task or function, making your playbooks more understandable.

Example Role: Installing Tomcat

https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/robertdebock/tomcat/install/


Create my own role

> Ansible-galaxy init rolename

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af275783-63b6-40ab-a319-645db283a40f)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34cfe34b-b8bc-4026-9014-0c07c952c3af)

Install tomcat

If you're looking to install or use an Ansible role for Tomcat from Ansible Galaxy, you can search for available roles and collections related to Tomcat. Here's how you can find and use a role related to Tomcat from Galaxy.
1.	Search for a Tomcat Role

https://galaxy.ansible.com/

To search for a role related to Tomcat on Ansible Galaxy, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy
ansible-galaxy search tomcat
This will return a list of roles related to Tomcat that you can install and use.

2. Install a Tomcat Role
Once you’ve found a suitable role for Tomcat, you can install it using the ansible-galaxy install command.
For example, if you find a role called geerlingguy.tomcat, you can install it by running:
bash
Copy

> ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.tomcat

This will download and install the role into your ~/.ansible/roles/ directory (or the path defined in your ansible.cfg file).
3. Use the Installed Tomcat Role in Your Playbook
After installing the role, you can use it in your playbook. Here’s an example of a simple playbook that installs and configures Tomcat:
yaml
Copy

Deploywar.yml::
=============

---
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  roles:
  - robertdebock.java
  - robertdebock.tomcat
 
  > ansible-playbook -i hosts Deploywar.yml
  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306fd1fc-8c51-40f7-81b6-41a44e6ee915)

  
This will use the geerlingguy.tomcat role to set up Tomcat on your webservers hosts.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36703856/access-tomcat-manager-app-from-different-host


For Tomcat v8.5.4 and above, the file <tomcat>/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml has been adjusted:

<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" >
    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />
</Context>

		Change this file to comment the Valve:
<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" >
    <!--
    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
    allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />
    -->
</Context>

After that, refresh your browser (not need to restart Tomcat), you can see the manager page.

Most of the work is done 
Where is my war file



Deploy Onlinebook store war to tomcat server using roles::
==============================================================

>If war file is available in local machine use copy module

>if war file is available other machine(internet) use get_url module

Tomcat by default install

>/opt/tomcat

From root folder we need to access webapps folder in tomcat otherwise permission denied

 Docker Introductions::
=================

Docker is an opensource & Applicatuions level virtualization technology and it's called containirazition.

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in lightweight, portable containers. Containers are isolated environments that package an application and all its dependencies (such as libraries, binaries, and configurations) to ensure it runs uniformly across different computing environments.

<img width="1162" height="449" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f4d8e0c-cc94-4210-84be-f7d7898aad1d" />


Docker is a platform and that make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable units that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.


container ::
==============
1.container is an insolation area of executuions of your applications
 OR
 instance of images are called containers
2.Containers are created from “images”
3. Containers are the core of Docker. They are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments where applications run.
  Docker is run your software packages /Applications  in containers called containarizations.

4. if you build a docker container for your application called containerization
5. containers have it’s own boundaries  

who will create containers?
Ans --docker images are created the containers

 Docker Images:
 ===============

 docker image is a package with all dependencies and the necessary 
information to create the container and docker image derived from multiple base images.

An image is a snapshot of a container, a blueprint that defines what the container will contain and how it will behave when run. It consists of an application and its dependencies. Docker images are built using a Dockerfile

Docker Registry::
====================

A Docker Registry is a system for storing and distributing Docker images. It is a centralized location where Docker images can be uploaded (pushed), stored, and downloaded (pulled) by users and applications. Docker images are the building blocks of containers, and registries provide a way to manage, version, and share these images across different environments.

Default registry :: https://hub.docker.com/

Physical & Virtual & Hypervisors/VMwares::
=============================================

1.tomcat & nodejs containers have it’s own process tree,own files systems,own network interfaces own storage,ram…etc
2.when you want to give application to your team/testers  docker is the best choice and when you want give system to your team/ testers VMwares are best choice.
3.application level virtulization docker is the best choice and OS level virtulization VMwares are best choice
4.individually scale the your application very easy in docker

<img width="1162" height="449" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05494c3a-210c-4a65-a07e-59f6170d17cf" />



Example:: For festival season In your organization leave management application multiple employees are applied leaves at the same time in that scenario docker is very easy to scale the one more application but physically it’s very difficult so docker is the best choice

Docker High Level Client -Server Architecture::
==================================


<img width="1700" height="665" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c95b9d4-34ac-4795-aa30-addb1952b6a3" />



Docker's high-level architecture revolves around several components that work together to provide containerization and isolation for applications


Docker Client (CLI)::
=================

The Docker Client is the primary interface for interacting with Docker. It can be a command-line interface (CLI), like the docker command, or a graphical interface (GUI) in some tools.

It allows users to interact with Docker's features, such as building containers, running containers, and managing containers and images.

It sends requests to the Docker Daemon to execute commands.

Docker Daemon (Dockerd)::
====================

The Docker Daemon (also known as dockerd) is the core component of Docker. It runs in the background on the host system.

The daemon is responsible for managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests and handles container lifecycle operations such as starting, stopping, and building containers.

The Docker Daemon can communicate with multiple Docker clients, allowing for distributed management of containers.

Flow:
============
1.The Docker Client sends a command to the Docker Daemon.

2.The Docker Daemon interacts with containers, images, and storage volumes.

3.The Docker Daemon can pull images from a Docker Registry.

4.The Docker Daemon runs containers based on the images and handles networking and storage.

Docker commands::
====================

 >docker pull <imagename>

 >docker pull hello-world

 >docker images   ----used to display the all images

 > docker image ls ----used to display the all images
 
 >docker run ---used to build the images and create the container


10/12/2025::
==============

Class Note Docker commands::
==============================


Docker commands::

>docker pull <imagename>

>docker pull hello-world

>docker images

Common Commands:
  run         Create and run a new container from an image
  
  exec        Execute a command in a running container
 
  ps          List containers
  
 
  build       Build an image from a Dockerfile
  
  bake        Build from a file
 
  pull        Download an image from a registry
 
  push        Upload an image to a registry

  images      List images
 
  login       Authenticate to a registry
 
  logout      Log out from a registry
 
  search      Search Docker Hub for images
 
  version     Show the Docker version information
  
  info        Display system-wide information

>docker pull <imagename>:<tagname>

>docker pull hello-world:latest

>docker run hello-world:latest

>docker ps

>docker ps -a

>docker rm <containerID> OR <containerName>

NOTE:: one image we can able to cerate number of containers

>docker rm $(docker ps -a)

i want install jenkins using docker conatiners

>docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:jdk17\

>docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:jdk17
 running the contaenr in background
 
 >docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:jdk17
 
 go to the inside the conatainers pleas euse below command
 
 >docker exec -it <containerID> /bin/bash

 >docker exec -it 1d9f1ee478e5 /bin/bash

Create the Jenkins container::
=================================

>docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:jdk21


http://35.155.150.89:8080/


<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/530aabac-2e7f-4db6-aa07-bde32e46cd12" />



>docker ps

above command is used to verify the how many containers are running




Create the Nginx web based application container::
=======================================================

>docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx:latest

http://35.155.150.89/

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/003a7ca7-5a81-4ea6-8b60-3c1dd0b7a74d)


>docker ps

above command is used to verify the how many containers are running, you can seee nginx container is running state



detached mode::
=================

Docker detached mode refers to running a container in the background

>docker run -d <image_name>

example::
> docker run -d nginx

Where:

-d is the flag for detached mode.

<image_name> is the name of the Docker image you want to run.

> docker run -d nginx

This command will:

Run the nginx container in detached mode.

Start the container in the background.

To view the containers running in detached mode, you can use the docker ps command:
======================================

>docker ps

Stopping a Container::
=================

>docker stop <containerID>

Start a Container::
=================

>docker start <containerID>

To run a command inside a running container:
======================

>docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> <command>
>docker exec -it 5336d949f33b /bin/bash

>root@5336d949f33b:/# hostname
5336d949f33b
>root@5336d949f33b:/# hostname -i
172.17.0.3


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7114894-3fcd-46b0-b393-6f296d23b845)

NOTE:::
=========

>docker exec -it 5178eb58223a /bin/bash
Use this command inside the container

>ctrl pq
Outside the containers

Docker Introduction::

--docker is a open source contaniraztion platform
--application level virtulazition platform docker is best choice 
--lightweight platform
--

container:: insolated area of running your application

images:: image is package with all the dependencies and the necessary information to 
create the contaienrs

if you build a docker containers for your application called containarization

who created the containers?

images are created by containarization

Docker registry::

storage area of images called docker registry

Dockerfile Introduction::
=================

A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It defines the environment and application setup, including dependencies, configurations, and the necessary steps to get your application running in a container.

dockerfile is a text file, and it have set up of all instructiuons

https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/


Dockerfile::dockerfile is text file, and it have set up of all instructiuons

FROM nginx or ubuntu or 

LABEL "AUthor =nagaraju@gamil.com"

RUN apt update && apt-get install jenkins -y

COPY . .  ----src destnations

ADD  . . -----src destinatuion

CMD ["echo",".jar"]

ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "war"]

EXPOSE 8080,8085

ENV APP_HOME ="Ifocus SOlutions pvt ltd"

WORKDIR $APP_HOME /app

VOLUME 

Key Components of a Dockerfile:
==========================

FROM: Specifies the base image for the Docker image you're creating.

FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN: Executes commands inside the container, often used to install dependencies.

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3

COPY or ADD: Copies files from your local machine into the container.

COPY . /app

WORKDIR: Sets the working directory for any subsequent commands in the Dockerfile.


WORKDIR /app

CMD: Specifies the command to run when a container is started from the image.

CMD ["python3", "app.py"]

EXPOSE: Defines the network ports the container will listen on at runtime.

EXPOSE 8080

ENV: Sets environment variables inside the container.
ENV APP_ENV=production
CMD & ENTRPOINT can be executed starting of the container

CMD & ENTRYPOINT Different::
===========================
--use CMD you can change the value but ENTRYPOINT not possible to change the value at the starting of the container
--CMD you can change the argument value 
--ENTRYPOINT can’t change the argument value

CMD ["echo",".jar"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "war"]

CMD/ENTRYPOINT ====should have something which runs till your app is alive

Note::
=======
life time of your container -->time which your cmd/entrypont is alive


Example Dockerfile:::
====================

Here’s a simple Dockerfile example that builds a nodejs web app:

>root@ip-172-31-18-253:~# sudo vi Dockerfile


# Use an official Node.js runtime as a base image
FROM node:18

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json .

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]

A **Dockerfile** is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It defines the environment and application setup, including dependencies, configurations, and the necessary steps to get your application running in a container. Essentially, it's the blueprint for creating Docker images.

### Key Components of a Dockerfile:
1. **FROM**: Specifies the base image for the Docker image you're creating.
   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:20.04
   ```

2. **RUN**: Executes commands inside the container, often used to install dependencies.
   ```dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
   ```

3. **COPY** or **ADD**: Copies files from your local machine into the container.
   ```dockerfile
   COPY . /app
   ```

4. **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory for any subsequent commands in the Dockerfile.
   ```dockerfile
   WORKDIR /app
   ```

5. **CMD**: Specifies the command to run when a container is started from the image.
   ```dockerfile
   CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
   ```

6. **EXPOSE**: Defines the network ports the container will listen on at runtime.
   ```dockerfile
   EXPOSE 8080
   ```

7. **ENV**: Sets environment variables inside the container.
   ```dockerfile
   ENV APP_ENV=production
   ```

### Example Dockerfile
Here’s a simple Dockerfile example that builds a Python web app:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Install the required dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Building and Running a Docker Image:
Once you’ve written your Dockerfile, you can build and run it using Docker commands:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   ```

2. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-app
   ```

The Dockerfile streamlines the process of creating consistent and reproducible environments, making it easier to deploy applications across different systems.

Kubernetes Overview::
========================


Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google.

free and opensource container orchestration platform developed by Google along with many open source contributors

it is production grade

free for personal and commercial use

as it is opensource, we won't get support from Google

only supports command line interface (CLI)

doesn't support web console

Kubernetes does provide some basic Dashboard but it is considered a security vulnerability, hence no one uses the Kubernetes Dashboard

Rancher is opensource webconsole for Google Kubernetes

supports inbuilt monitoring features

it can check the health of our application, when it finds your application is not responding, it can repair it or replace it with another good healthy instance of your application
it supports inbuilt load-balancing

1.Container Orchestration: Kubernetes helps you manage multiple containers, ensuring that they run efficiently and reliably across many servers.

2.Scaling: Kubernetes can automatically scale your applications up or down based on demand, making it easier to handle varying workloads.

3.Load Balancing: It can distribute network traffic to different containers, ensuring that applications remain responsive even under heavy loads.

4.Self-Healing: If a container crashes or stops working, Kubernetes can automatically restart or replace it, ensuring the application stays available.

5.Automated Deployment and Rollback: Kubernetes can automate the process of deploying new versions of an application, and if something goes wrong, it can roll back to a previous version.

6.Storage Management: Kubernetes can automatically mount the storage resources you need for your applications, making it easier to manage persistent data.

In short, Kubernetes is designed to make it easier to manage applications at scale in a way that is highly automated, reliable, and efficient. It’s widely used in DevOps platform

Cluster:: collection of nodes with a single responsibility

All the nodes in that cluster do same process, same type of work can will do collection of nodes in cluster

Cluster::
a cluster might refer to a set of virtual machines or containers working together for a specific application or service.


Kubernetes Cluster Components:
==================================

1.Master Node (Control Plane): The Master Node is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster. It manages the cluster and makes decisions about scheduling, scaling, and maintaining the health of the application. The control plane consists of several key components:

1.API Server::
The API server exposes the Kubernetes API, which is used to interact with the cluster.

2.Scheduler::
The scheduler assigns work (pods) to available worker nodes.

3.Controller Manager: :
Ensures that the desired state of the system is maintained, such as ensuring that the correct number of pods are running.

4.etcd:
A distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data, including the state of the system (like deployed pods, config maps, and secrets).

Worker Nodes (Minions):
=========================

o The Worker Nodes are responsible for running the actual application workloads. These nodes host the pods, which are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A worker node typically runs:

1.Kubelet: An agent that ensures the containers in the pods are running and healthy.

2.Kube Proxy: A network proxy that maintains network rules for pod communication.

3.Container Runtime: The software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

4.Pods::

A pod is the smallest unit of execution in Kubernetes and can contain one or more containers that share resources such as networking and storage. Pods are always deployed in a Kubernetes cluster and are managed by the control plane.




Services:
===============
A service in Kubernetes is a way to expose an application running in a pod to other pods or external users. It ensures that network communication between pods is reliable, even as pods are dynamically created or destroyed.

1.Pod is a smallest component in kubernetes 

2.In docker smallest component --  > container

3.in kuberneties we will create pods and inside the pods containers are running.

4.one pod speak with other pod using id address(kube-proxy)

5.every pod has ip address

Above picture directly using pods without using services and if ipaddress no longer available our application is not worked. pods communication throw ip address right so it has a problem to resolved the this problem services is come to the picture.


With Services::
==================

Services –logical entity and maintain ip address


Basically kubernetes is used for maintain containers


Kubeadm::
============
bootstraps a cluster. It’s designed to be a simple way for new users to build clusters (more detail on this is in a later chapter).

Kubectl::
===========
is a tool for interacting with your existing cluster.

Kubelet: 
============
An agent that ensures the containers in the pods are running and check healthy.
